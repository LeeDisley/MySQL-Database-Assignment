## Advanced Database Assignment

## Introduction
These files make up my Advanced database assignment for my BSc Computing course at The University of Bolton.  The score for this unit comprises the 94% for this part and 66% for the exam, which gives 80% overall or a first.

The aim of the assignment was to create a database for the management of student accomodation, on campus and private rent.  It also
included the recording of flat inspections and payments.

There is no setup file containing the database schema as this was not required for the assignment, but scripts for creation of the database are included.

The files include:

-Scripts

-Data for the database, created using mockaroo

-Docx files showing the scripts working

-Assignment hand in file showing above script docs and the queries performed on the database to fulfill the assignment.

-Report for assignment on possible setup of backend for the database
