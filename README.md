## Advanced Database Assignment

## Introduction
These files make up my Advanced database assignment for my BSc Computing course at The University of Bolton.  The score for this unit comprises the 94% for this part and 66% for the exam, which gives 80% overall or a first.

The aim of the assignment was to create a database for the management of student accomodation, on campus and private rent.  It also
included the recording of flat inspections and payments.

The files include:
-Scripts
-Data for the database, created using mockaroo
